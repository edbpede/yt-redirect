 * End-to-end configuration.

 * Runs against the real static build rather than the dev server: the build is
 * what ships, and it is the only thing that exercises Astro's Rust compiler and
 * the Svelte hydration output together. Nearly all of this app's behaviour is
 * client-side, so this suite — not smoke.yml — is what actually covers it.
 *
 * The site deploys to the root of a custom domain (no `base` in
 * astro.config.mjs), so baseURL is the bare origin.
