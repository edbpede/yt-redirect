/**
 * Serves the static build for the end-to-end run.
 *
 * `astro preview` is not used here: in Astro 7 it registers a background daemon,
 * so a second invocation detects the first and exits immediately — which makes
 * Playwright's `webServer` (it expects a foreground process it owns) fail with
 * "Process from config.webServer exited early" whenever a stale daemon lingers.
 * A plain file server has no shared state, so the suite is deterministic locally
 * and in CI.
 *
 * Serves dist/ the way the site is actually deployed, including the
 * directory-index and 404 behaviour of a typical static host.
 *
 *   bun run scripts/serve-dist.ts [--port 4321] [--base ""]
 *   PORT=4321 bun run scripts/serve-dist.ts
 *
 * Binds 0.0.0.0 so IPv4 probes from a CI step reach it regardless of how the
 * runner resolves localhost.
